## Welcome to BrewTap!

Tap into all of your local breweries with BrewTap!

This application utilizes an API from openbrewerydb.org to display brewery name, type and street address.

BrewTap allows the user to look up all the breweries in their area by typing in their city and state into the search bars.  Both city and state MUST be entered into the search bars or else the application won't return anything.  This is to ensure that breweries from different towns that share the same name don't get mixed into the list to better optimize search results.  The state name must be typed out in its entirety.  NO ABBREVIATIONS.  The API will not be able to handle that information so once again, nothing will be returned.

Once city and state have been entered into the search bars, a list of breweries in the area will then append to the page with the breweries name, street and type.

A list of brewery types is posted to the right of the page to assist the user in identifying the type of brewery.  This list has been taken from the openbrewerydb.org API with some slight edits.

A like and dislike button will also append to the page underneath the name and type of brewery.  They are labeled 'Gulp' and 'Belch' respectively.  When you like a brewery, the like button will be disabled and the 'Gulp' font-color will turn green.  The same will happen with the dislike button.  The only difference is the 'Belch' font-color will turn red.

While scrolling through the list of breweries, the brewery name, street and type will be highlighted as the mouse moves over the text.  Once the mouse leaves the text the highlight will disappear.

Happy Hunting!
